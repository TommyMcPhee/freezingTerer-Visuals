# freezingTerereVisuals

This code is used to build the (stereo) audio reactive visuals for Freezing  Terer√©!
This project uses the OpenFrameworks environment (https://openframeworks.cc/download/). It can be built on Windows, MacOS, or Linux by utilizing the ProjectGenerator to make a new project (or simply configuring the default files and libraries in the same way), replacing the /src file with this source code and the /data file with this data code (the shader.frag and shader.vert are the only relevant files to replace in there). This project uses OpenGL version 3.2.

Some files were accidentally added, but deleting a file entirely is much less straightforward than one would think so I am still in the process of figuring out how to remove them. In the meantime, simply ignore the five blank files.
