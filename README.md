# freezingTerereVisuals

This code is used to build the audio reactive visuals for Freezing  Terer√©!
This project uses the OpenFrameworks environment. It can be built on Windows, MacOS, or Linux by utilizing the ProjectGenerator to make a new project (or simply configuring the default files and libraries in the same way), replacing the /src file with this source code and the /data file with this data code (the shader.frag and shader.vert are the only relevant files to replace in there). The project uses OpenGL version 3.2.
